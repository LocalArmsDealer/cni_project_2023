    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p class=".tab">Fossil fuels power most of the US. According to <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1258-october-3-2022-2021-40-electricity-produced-united-states-was">The Department of Energy</a>, around 65% of energy production in 2021 was from fossil fuels, with the majority being from natural gas (graph below ↓↓↓). Of the remaining 35%, around 10% is nuclear power. Should that number be higher, is it high enough, or should it be lower? I don't have an answer, but I can provide information and a lot of sources.</p>

    <h3>Viewpoint 1: More Nuclear</h3>
    <p>Nuclear power produced 772 billion kWh (kilowatt hours) of power in 2022 according to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3">the Energy Information Administration</a>, which released a total of 0 p/kWh (pounds per kilowatt hour) of carbon. If that power were produced via natural gas, that would release 0.97 p/kWh <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&amp;t=11">(Source)</a> for a total of approximately 374.42 million tons of carbon, all of which would be released into the atmosphere. </p>
