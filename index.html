    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p class=".tab">Fossil fuels power most of the US. According to <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1258-october-3-2022-2021-40-electricity-produced-united-states-was">The Department of Energy</a>, around 65% of energy production in 2021 was from fossil fuels, with the majority being from natural gas (graph below ↓↓↓). Of the remaining 35%, around 20% is nuclear power. Should that number be higher, is it high enough, or should it be lower? I don't have an answer, but I can provide information and a lot of sources.</p>

    <h3>Viewpoint 1: More Nuclear</h3>
    <!--Carbon Argument-->
    <p>Nuclear power produced 772 billion kWh (kilowatt hours) of power in 2022 according to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3">the Energy Information Administration</a>, which released a total of 0 p/kWh (pounds per kilowatt hour) of carbon. If that power were produced via natural gas, that would release 0.97 p/kWh <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&amp;t=11">(Source)</a> for a total of approximately 374.42 million tons of carbon, all of which would be released into the atmosphere. Since <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide">excess carbon causes temperatures to rise</a>, we want less of it in the atmosphere. Nuclear power doesn't release carbon, so nuclear power is a good alternative to fossil fuels.</p>
    <!--Jobs Argument-->
    <p>Nuclear power plants generate around 500,000 high-paying jobs, along with contributing $60mil to the US GDP per year according to <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/advantages-and-challenges-nuclear-energy">the DoE</a>. Those jobs improve the US economy, along with generating power for cities in the US. Nuclear power produces <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/infographic-how-much-power-does-nuclear-reactor-produce">19% of energy in the United States</a>, which is a low amount compared to fossil fuel usage. If we increased the amount of nuclear power production to 30%, we could replace 11% of US energy production from fossil fuels. This would double the amount of jobs created by nuclear power and contribute more to the GDP without contributing to global warming.</p>
    <p>Not everyone agrees that we should increase our nuclear power usage though. Some people think that</p>

    <h3>Viewpoint 2: We Have Enough</h3>
    <!--This one is going to be annoying to do, since most reliable sources pick viewpoint 1. I wonder why. (sarcasm)-->
    <!--Cost Argument-->
    <p>Nuclear power plants aren't free. Construction, while technically possible to do in your own backyard <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nuclear-101-how-does-nuclear-reactor-work">(here's how)</a>, costs money. Maintenance isn't cheap either, and staff need to be paid quite a bit. That money needs to be gained by corporations and individuals paying you their electricity bills, which means people need to choose to buy your power. Since <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/17/the-us-is-spending-billions-to-keep-money-losing-nuclear-plants-open.html">natural gas is cheaper than nuclear</a>, most corporations don't buy from nuclear plants, meaning it's harder to make more nuclear plants. So, might as well keep the amount the same.</p>
    <!--Nuclear Weapons Argument-->
    <p>Even if you aren't concerned with cost, the fuel for nuclear reactors isn't just used for power plants. The use of fissile materials for nuclear weapons is always a concern, especially when you're the one authorizing the trade of fissile materials to build power plants in a country. Of course, this isn't as much of a concern for domestic corporations, since the buildings for nuclear power and nuclear weapons are very different, but there's always the possibility that some shady group is building a nuclear bomb or two underground. Of course, this is more of an emotional concern than a factual one, but it's still entirely possible.</p>
    <p>For some people, stopping the production of new power plants isn't enough. Some people think we need</p>
